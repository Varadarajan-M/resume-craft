## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: `v20.x` or later
- **pnpm**: This project uses `pnpm`. You can install it with `npm install -g pnpm`.
- **MongoDB**: A running instance of MongoDB. A free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) cluster is a great option.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Fork the repository** and clone it to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Varadarajan-M/resume-craft.git
    cd resume-craft
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies** using `pnpm`:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```

    Now, fill in the required API keys and secrets in `.env.local`. You can get these from their respective services:

    - `DB_URL`: Your MongoDB connection string.
    - `CLERK_*`: Keys from your [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) dashboard.
    - `GROQ_API_KEY`: API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys).

4.  **Run the development server**:

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
